# ensahome-platform
ENSAHome is a full-stack student marketplace platform designed for ENSA students to find housing near campus and buy or sell used equipment.

The platform is built with a modern and scalable architecture, leveraging MongoDB sharding with Replica Sets and Mongos to ensure high availability, scalability, and flexible data management. The backend is developed using Spring Boot with Spring Security and JWT-based authentication, while the frontend is built with Next.js to provide a fast and responsive user experience.

This project was developed as part of a group academic project and focuses on real-world distributed systems and secure web application design.
